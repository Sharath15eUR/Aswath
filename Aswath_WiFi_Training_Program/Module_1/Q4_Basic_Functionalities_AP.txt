Question-4:
What are the basic functionalities of Wi-Fi Accesspoint

Fundamental Functions of a Wi-Fi Access Point (AP)
A Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) is hardware through which wireless devices are provided access to a wired network by utilizing Wi-Fi. It finds general usage at homes, workplaces, and public locations to give a wider reach of the network as well as provide wireless connection.

1. Transmission & Receipt of Wireless Signals
The AP sends and receives Wi-Fi signals to enable devices such as laptops, smartphones, and IoT devices to connect wirelessly.
Uses RF (Radio Frequency) waves to communicate with devices.
Supports various frequency bands:
2.4 GHz (longer range, slower speed)
5 GHz (shorter range, faster speed)
6 GHz (only in Wi-Fi 6E, faster & low interference)

2. Network Bridging (Wired to Wireless) 
An AP connects wired and wireless networks, enabling Wi-Fi devices to access an Ethernet-based network (LAN).
Ethernet Input (RJ45 Port): Connects to the central router or switch.
Wireless Output (Wi-Fi): Radiates the signal to surrounding devices.
This enables wireless devices to use the internet and local network resources.

3. SSID Broadcasting & Wi-Fi Network Identification 
An AP transmits an SSID (Service Set Identifier), or Wi-Fi network name that appears when users are looking for networks.
Example:
SSID: MyHomeWiFi
SSID: Company_Network
Users choose the SSID and enter a password (if protected) to connect.
Optional Features:
Hidden SSID: The AP has the ability to conceal the SSID for additional security (manual entry).
Multiple SSIDs: Guest networks and individual VLANs are permitted by some APs.

4. Wi-Fi Security & Encryption 
An AP provides secure communication through the use of encryption and authentication protocols.
Popular Wi-Fi Security Standards:
WEP (Weak - Obsolete)
WPA (Improved)
WPA2 (Standard)
WPA3 (Most Secure - Implemented in Wi-Fi 6/6E)
Encryption Techniques:
TKIP (Old, less secure)
AES (Strong, implemented in WPA2 & WPA3)
APs also provide:
MAC Address Filtering (Allow only certain devices)
Captive Portals (Used in public Wi-Fi networks)

5. DHCP & IP Address Management 
An AP distributes IP addresses to connected devices through DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) or relays DHCP requests to a router.
Example:
Router allocates: 192.168.1.2, 192.168.1.3, etc.
AP can function as a DHCP relay to control large networks.

6. Load Balancing & Band Steering Newer APs efficiently handle traffic to enhance performance.
Load Balancing:
Splits devices evenly among several APs to prevent congestion.
Example: In an office building, devices roam APs depending on usage.
Band Steering:
Forces devices to utilize 5 GHz over 2.4 GHz for increased speeds.

7. Roaming Support (ESS & Fast Handoff)
In a multi-AP network (ESS - Extended Service Set), an AP assists devices in roaming between APs without disconnecting.
Fast Roaming Technologies:
802.11r (Fast Transition)
802.11k (Neighbor Reports)
802.11v (Client Steering)
Example:
Traveling from Room A to Room B, your phone changes APs without ending your call.

8. Quality of Service (QoS) & Traffic Prioritization
APs are able to prioritize essential network traffic for seamless performance.
QoS (Quality of Service):
Gives higher priority to video calls, VoIP, and gaming traffic than normal browsing.
Guarantees low latency for real-time applications.
Example of QoS in action:
A Zoom conference is given greater priority than file downloads.

9. Power over Ethernet (PoE) Support 
Most business-class APs have PoE support, which receives power and network connectivity via a single Ethernet cable.
Benefits of PoE:
No additional power adapter required.
APs can be installed in ceilings, corridors, and outdoor areas.

10. Mesh Networking & AP Controller Support
Mesh Wi-Fi APs provide a self-healing, multi-AP network for uninterrupted coverage.
Mesh Networking:
Multiple APs collaborate to eliminate dead spots.
Example: Google Nest Wi-Fi, Eero, TP-Link Deco.
AP Controller Support:
Centralized AP management using software like UniFi Controller, Cisco WLC.
Admins can monitor, configure, and troubleshoot multiple APs easily.
