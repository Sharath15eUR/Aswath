Question-3:
what is BSS and ESS?
1. Basic Service Set (BSS)
Definition: A BSS is one wireless access point (AP) with related client devices (stations).
Components:
Access Point (AP) or Wi-Fi Router
Client devices (laptops, smartphones, IoT devices)
BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier):Each BSS has a unique MAC address for the access point.
Example: b4:a7:c6:e7:67:e5 (seen in your Wi-Fi properties).
Types of BSS:
Infrastructure BSS:
Has an access point (AP) that provides wireless devices connectivity to a wired network.
Example: Your home Wi-Fi router forming a network for all your devices.

Independent BSS (IBSS):
Also referred to as Ad-Hoc Mode, in which devices talk directly to each other without the use of an access point.
Example: Wi-Fi Direct or device-to-device communication.
Example of a BSS:
SSID: ASWATH S
BSSID: b4:a7:c6:e7:67:e5 (MAC address of the AP)
Devices Connected: Your laptop, smartphone, Raspberry Pi

2. Extended Service Set (ESS)
Definition: A multi-AP network that shares a single wired network, enabling seamless roaming.
Components:
Multiple BSSs (APs)
Same SSID for all APs
Shared wired network (LAN)
ESSID (Extended Service Set Identifier):The same SSID (Wi-Fi network name) is shared among multiple APs to enable seamless handoff.

Example Use Case:
Multiple APs are used in large buildings, offices, universities, airports, and hotels to provide extended coverage.
Your phone changes APs without losing connection.
Example of an ESS:
SSID: ASWATH S
AP 1's BSSID: b4:a7:c6:e7:67:e5
AP 2's BSSID: d0:6d:ef:4c:12:b3
AP 3's BSSID: f1:3e:aa:9d:56:c7
Your device will automatically connect to the closest AP.
