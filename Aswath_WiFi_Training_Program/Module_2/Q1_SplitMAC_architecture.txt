Question-1:
Brief about SplitMAC architecture and how it improves the AP's performance
SplitMAC architecture is a network architecture widely utilized within enterprise-class wireless networks to promote performance and scalability of Access Points (APs). The architecture separates the processing of a traditional monolithic AP into two sections:
Control Plane (Centralized/Controller-based):
      •	Performs non-time-sensitive tasks like authentication, security rules, QoS control, roaming decisions, and network management.
      •	Deployed within a Wireless LAN Controller (WLC) or a cloud-based controller.
Data Plane (Distributed/Local to AP):
      •	Manages time-critical operations such as frame forwarding, encryption/decryption, and packet buffering.
      •	Handled directly by the AP for quicker data transmission.
SplitMAC Architecture Enhances AP Performance
     1.	Improved Scalability:
       • Offloading control functions to a central controller alleviates the computational load from individual APs, enabling deployment of a higher number of APs without any impact on performance.
     2.	Increased Throughput:
       • With only the data plane handled by APs, high-speed data transfer is concentrated, leading to improved throughput and reduced latency for connected clients.
     3.	Simplified Management:
       • Centralized control simplifies network management, configuration, and troubleshooting, particularly in large deployments.
       • As the controller takes care of mobility management, the devices roam among APs seamlessly with no latency, enhancing user experience.
     4.	Increased Security:
       • With centralized authentication and policy management, the network becomes more secure by maintaining uniform enforcement of security policies.
     5.	Load Balancing:
       • The controller dynamically loads-balance traffic among APs, enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of the network.
