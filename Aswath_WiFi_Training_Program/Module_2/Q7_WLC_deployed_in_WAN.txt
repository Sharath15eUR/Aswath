Question-7:
If WLC deployed in WAN, which AP mode is best for local network and how?

Hybrid Mode (FlexConnect Mode)
This mode is part of the Lightweight AP architecture but specifically designed to handle scenarios where the WLC is remote (e.g., deployed over a WAN).
Working:
1.APs establish a CAPWAP Control Tunnel to the WLC over the WAN.
2.Data traffic is switched locally at the AP unless configured to be tunneled back to the controller (usually not preferred in WAN scenarios).
3.Keep-Alive messages are exchanged to maintain the control tunnel.
4.During WAN failures, the APs continue serving clients using local switching until the WLC becomes reachable again.
