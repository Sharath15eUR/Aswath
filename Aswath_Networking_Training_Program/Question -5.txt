Question-5:

Understand what happens when dupicate Ips are configured in a network

A. Network Disruptions
Devices with the duplicate IPs may become unreachable or intermittently lose connection.
Users may experience slow or dropped network connections.
B. ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) Issues
When a device sends an ARP request to resolve an IP address, it expects a single MAC address in response.
If two devices reply with the same IP, it confuses the network, causing packet loss.
C. Connection Drops
If a router assigns an IP that is already in use, either the old or the new device may lose connectivity.
